= Lemmatize

The xref:tutorial/tag-parts-of-speech.adoc[part-of-speech tags] allow the xref:tutorial/tokenize.adoc[tokens] to be
lemmatized. Lemmatization involves turning a word into its base form, or _lemma_. For example, the words `am`, `are`
and `is` are all forms of the verb `be`. This process allows variants of the same word to be recognised.
