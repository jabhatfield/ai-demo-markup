= List lemmatized classification data

This endpoint lists the lemmatized classification data used for training the chatbot. It consists of lemmatized
chat phrases that a user could potentially type, along with their associated reply category.

Note the following two advantages of lemmatizing the training data:

* The input message data is xref:tutorial/lemmatize.adoc[also lemmatized] and therefore aligns more closely
when calculating a match
* Less training data is required because fewer variants of words are required: variants converge onto their lemma.
