= Chat

The chat endpoint uses all the previous techniques to prepare a message:

1. xref:tutorial/tokenize.adoc[Tokenization]
2. xref:tutorial/tag-parts-of-speech.adoc[Part-of-speech tagging]
3. xref:tutorial/lemmatize.adoc[Lemmatization]

The chatbot is then trained on xref:tutorial/list-lemmatized-classification-data.adoc[lemmatized classification data],
which maps various potential input expressions to a set of
xref:tutorial/list-possible-chat-responses.adoc[possible chat responses]. Finally, the endpoint replies with the most
probable response from the set of possible responses.
