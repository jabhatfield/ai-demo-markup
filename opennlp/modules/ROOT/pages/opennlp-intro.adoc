== Introduction

*Zoo Chatbot* uses OpenNLP to train a set of question patterns about a zoo and match them to 1 of 5 answers.
It can then generate the probabilities of each answer being correct.

The API is composed of the following:

* POST request to classify a single word TODO check
* POST request to tokenize a sentence
* POST request to tag tokens with parts-of-speech
* POST request to lemmatize tokens tagged with parts-of-speech
* POST request to chat by sending a sentence
* GET request to retrieve possible chat responses
* GET request to retrieve the lemmatized training data
