== Natural Language Processing

*Natural Language Processing* (*NLP*) is the leverage of computing to understand language. It involves a variety of
linguistic datasets, or _corpora_, along with associated algorithms that process this data to form language models.
Zoo Chatbot implements https://opennlp.apache.org[OpenNLP,window=_blank] to perform the following NLP tasks, which are
explained in following sections:

* <<_tokenization>>
* <<_part_of_speech_tagging>>
* <<_lemmatization>>
* <<_categorisation>>

== Tokenization

== Part-of-speech tagging

== Lemmatization

== Categorisation
