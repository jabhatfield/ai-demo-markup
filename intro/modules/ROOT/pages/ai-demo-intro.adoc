== Introduction

*RESTful AI Demo* (*RAID*) is a simple set of APIs for learning *machine learning* (*ML*) and
*deep learning* (*DL*). It is written in Java Spring Boot and consists of two components:

* xref:zoo-chatbot-component::zoo-chatbot-intro.adoc[Zoo Chatbot](ML): enquires about a zoo, based on
https://opennlp.apache.org[Apache OpenNLP,window=_blank] *natural language processing* (*NLP*).
* xref:handwriting-recogniser-component::handwriting-recogniser-intro.adoc[Handwriting Recogniser](DL): recognition of
handwritten digits, based on https://djl.ai[Deep Java Library,window=_blank] (*DJL*) image recognition.

== Definitions of machine learning and deep learning

ML is a subset of AI and DL is a subset of ML:

=== Machine learning

* Typically involves providing an algorithm with example input and corresponding output data, then letting the
algorithm run iteratively to learn the nature of these mappings
* Iteratively adjusts its parameters and compares its calculated output, derived from the input, to the defined output
* Once the model is trained in this manner it can predict the classification of relevant input

=== Deep learning

* Similar to ML in that it also learns through an iterative algorithm
* Typically uses much more input data and stores its calculations in a neural network structure
* The data and relationships of data are stored as nodes and weighted vectors
* Powerful enough to learn on its own, without provision of example output
