== Introduction

*RESTful AI Demo* (*RAID*) is a simple set of APIs for learning *Machine Learning* (*ML*) and
*Deep Learning* (*DL*). It is written in Java Spring Boot and consists of two components:

* xref:1.0@opennlp-component::opennlp-intro.adoc[ML chatbot] for enquires about a zoo, based on https://opennlp.apache.org[Apache OpenNLP,window=_blank]
*Natural Language Processing* (*NLP*)
* xref:1.0@djl-component::djl-intro.adoc[DL image recognition] of handwriting, based on https://djl.ai[Deep Java Library,window=_blank] (*DJL*)

Use the controls in the bottom left corner of the screen to switch between documentation for each component.

== Definitions of Machine Learning and Deep Learning

ML is a subset of AI and DL is a subset of ML:

=== Machine Learning

* Typically involves providing an algorithm with example input and corresponding output data, then letting the
algorithm run iteratively to learn the nature of these mappings
* Iteratively adjusts its parameters and compares its calculated output, derived from the input, to the defined output
* Once the model is _trained_ in this manner it can predict the classification of relevant input

=== Deep Learning

* Similar to ML in that it also learns through an iterative algorithm
* Typically uses much more input data and stores its calculations in a neural network structure
* The data and relationships of data are stored as nodes and weighted vectors
* Powerful enough to learn on its own, without provision of example output
