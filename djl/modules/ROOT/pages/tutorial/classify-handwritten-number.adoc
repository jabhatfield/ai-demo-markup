= Classify a handwritten number

This endpoint classifies any image of a handwritten number that conforms to the <<_image_format,image format>>.
A neural network trained on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database[MNIST database of handwritten digits,window=_blank]
performs the classification.

== Handwritten-zero request

Send the following request to explicitly process the same image processed by the xref:tutorial/classify-handwritten-zero.adoc[]
endpoint
image:https://github.com/jabhatfield/ai-demo/blob/main/src/main/resources/images/0.png?raw=true[0,20,20]:

[source,json]
.POST /handwriting-recogniser/classify-handwritten-number

----

[#handwritten-zero-response]
== Response

include::intro-component::partial$data-truncation-note.adoc[]

Notice that the image is recognised as `0`, with a high probability of correctness:

== Ambiguous request

Send the following request to process an ambiguous image of a three that looks like an eight
image:https://github.com/jabhatfield/ai-demo/blob/main/src/main/resources/images/3-that-looks-like-8.png?raw=true[3-like-8,20,20]:

.POST /handwriting-recogniser/classify-handwritten-number
----
include::example$handwritten-3-like-8-request.json[]
----

== Response

include::intro-component::partial$data-truncation-note.adoc[]

Notice that the image is recognised as `3`, with a lower probability of correctness than the less ambiguous
<<_handwritten_zero_request,handwritten zero>>. Also notice that the second most probable match is `8`:

== Custom request

Create a new image to experiment with the image recognition capabilities.

=== Image format

The image format is based on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database[MNIST database format,window=_blank]. Images
must have the following properties:

* Resemble a number from zero to nine
* Written in white with a black background
* Sized 28x28 pixels
* PNG format

Place the image in the
https://github.com/jabhatfield/ai-demo/tree/main/src/main/resources/images[images source folder,window=_blank]:
`src/main/resources/images`.

Verify registration via the xref:tutorial/list-example-input-images.adoc[] endpoint.

=== Request body

Send a request structured as per the <<_handwritten_zero_request,handwritten-zero request>>, substituting `fileName` with the name
of the created image.

== Response

Expect a response structured as per the <<handwritten-zero-response,handwritten-zero response>>. Notice that the legibility
of the handwritten number corresponds to the probability of correctness.
