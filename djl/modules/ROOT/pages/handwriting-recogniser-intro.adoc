== Introduction

Handwriting Recogniser uses http://djl.ai[DJL,window=_blank] to train a neural network on images of handwritten numbers
within the range of 0 - 9. It can then generate the probabilities of an input image matching each of these numbers.

The API is composed of the following:

* POST request to classify a handwritten zero
* POST request to classify any given image of a handwritten number
* GET request to retrieve available images

== Classify a handwritten zero
